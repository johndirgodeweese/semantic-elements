        <h2 id="What">What Are Semantic Elements?</h2>
        <p>Semantic elements are the structure of an HTML document.  It is much like the structure of a good book - with a forward, table of contents, chapters and maybe an index or bibliography at the end.  Semantic elements are not the style or beauty of the page - they are the structure upon which the style can later be applied.  A purely semantic webpage is not attractive.  This is an example of that.</p>

        <h2 id="Why">Why Are They Used?</h2>
        <p>The use of appropriate and relevant semantic elements make the effective use of the document possible, by assisting with translation and readability with assistive technologies. In addition, by separating the substance from the style, the author has greater flexibility for both editing and re-design.  Search engines like good semantic element usage too!</p>

        <h3>Why the &lt;Div&gt; Tag Should Die</h3>
        <p>The short answer is "because it was and is confusing as hell".  It is used to group things together and attempt to provide some type of structure - but a single tag can't indicate navigation, an article, some header data and 20 other structural elements without being confusing.  Thanks &lt;div&gt; - you did the best you could, now step aside.</p>
